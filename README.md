# My-simple-reactApp
below is the step I done my task: <br/>
1)install the git in my computer  <br/>
2)install the node.js in my visual studio <br/>
3)set up the git in to my visual studio <br/>
4)set up the node.js to my visual studio <br/>
5)use window "terminal"  to debug the app <br/>
  and cd to my project task <br/>
6)open the window terminal with type in code "npm install --global expo-cli" to  <br/>
  install the expo in my computer <br/>
7)type in the code "expo register" and redirect to the expo website to register  <br/>
  the account. <br/>
8)After I register the account, I type in the "expo login" to the terminal to <br/>
 login in my account. If I login succesful, I also type the code "expo whoami"  <br/>
 to confirm the account is me or not login yet. <br/>
9)after check the user login if the user is corrent than I will create the new <br/>
  project folder called "my-simple-Reactapp". after create the project I type the code <br/>
  "cd my-simple-Reactapp" and type the code "code." to open the project in visual studio<br/>
10)In the project first I create 1 folder called "screens" and add two pages, one is "home.js" <br/>
  and another one is "second.js", and than I install the "react-navigation/core" in "App.js" for navigate the 3 pages. <br/>
11)After I make the pages can naviagate already, in the "home.js" I write the "Welcome" in header and add 1 button in <br/>
   home pages for Navigate to details page. why it can Navigate is because it depend the "name" and "component".<br/>
   the "name" is showing in the header and also in "App.js" inside will depend the "name" is which pages. <br/>
12)and done the "home.js", I do the "secondpage.js", in that page I want to display the table inside got 2 data, the table <br/>
   is using the "react-native-paper", so I type the code "expo install react-native-paper" to install the "react-native paper". <br/>
   after I install succesfully I create the table to display the data. <br/>
13)inside the data is need to check the device-info. So I type the code "expo install expo-device" <br/>
   to install the "expo-device" to check the device and display it in second data, the first data <br/>
   is title of data. <br/>
14)I done all the thing I create the branch to commit to my github project. <br/>
